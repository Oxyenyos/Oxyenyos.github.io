##My Portfolio Site

Hello, there! I am Alok Prateek, a computer science student from Delhi, India.
I am intrested in front-end design, I like the ways in which visual aids elegantly help to convey a message across the audience.
For this site I've used static content to demonstrate my experiments with these technologies.
I've designed the site in three parts:
	*The main portfolio page:* this was built using HTML5 and JS
	*The experiments:* These are mostly css and js based which I designed over many years, some for competions and some for fun.



### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  - jQuery.js
  - Scrolly.js

### List of known Bugs
1. Polygon menu doesnt center properly on mobile
2. About me is checked even on intro section
3. some devicons dont show up.
